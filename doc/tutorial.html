<h2>Lesson 1: Creating HTML list of your publications</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open a terminal emulator and type the following commands on the shell
prompt</p>
<pre><code>mkdir yacite_sandbox
cd yacite_sandbox
</code></pre>
<p>This creates a new working directory. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will need a BibTeX ('*.bib') database file containing your publications.
    You can download it from a bibliographic database like Scopus of Web of
    Science or Google Scholar. Save the file (let us call it <code>mypubs.bib</code>) in the
    <code>yacite_sandbox</code> directory you created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go back to the shell prompt (the current directory should be <code>yacite
    sandbox</code> and type the following command </p>
<pre><code>bib2yaml mypubs.bib
</code></pre>
<p>This command prints on its standard output a series of records in YAML
format, we call this <em>a YAML stream</em>. A YAML stream consists of a sequence
of records that look like this:</p>
<pre><code>authors: ['Jenča, Gejza']

</code></pre>
<p>The records in the YAML stream are separated by triple minus <code>---</code>. </p>
<p>Unlike BibTeX, YAML is a popular way to represent data in the current world of
computing. Probably in every programming language, there is a library to
read and write YAML data. Unlike other serialization formats (like
XML), the YAML format was designed to be both human-readable and
human-editable. It can be edited using any text editor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What we want to do now is to convert a YAML stream into a HTML document.
    This is accomplished using a <em>template</em>. A HTML template is a HTML file
    containing special non-HTML control sequences 
    representing variables, loops, conditions
    etc. <code>yacite</code> uses the jinja2 template language.</p>
<p>The templates are kept in a separate directory. Create the
directory on the command prompt:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir templates
</code></pre>
<p>To keep things simple, we shall create a very simple template. Open your
favorite text editor and type in the following jinja2 code.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;List of publications&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
# for rec in records:
&lt;li&gt;
{{  rec.authors|join(", ") }}
&lt;em&gt;{{rec.title}}&lt;/em&gt;,
{{rec.journal}},
&lt;strong&gt;{{rec.volume}}&lt;/strong&gt;
({{rec.year}})
{{rec.startpage}}-{{rec.endpage}}
&lt;/li&gt;
# endfor
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This is pretty much self explanatory. The jinja2 commands start with <code>#</code>.
The variables are enclosed in double curly brackets. The construction</p>
<pre><code>{{  rec.authors|join(", ") }}
</code></pre>
<p>means that the authors should be separated by a comma and a space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save the template under some name, let us say <code>publist.html</code> in the
    <code>templates</code> directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type in the following command on the shell prompt.</p>
<pre><code>bib2yaml mypubs.bib | yacite render publist.html
</code></pre>
<p>This is called a <em>pipe sequence</em>. The whole <code>yacite</code> system is based on
pipe sequences. There are two commands at work here. The <code>bib2yaml</code> command
produces a YAML stream as its output. The <code>|</code> sign (called <em>pipe</em>) in the middle connects
the output of the <code>bib2yaml</code> command and with the input of the other
command, <code>yacite render</code>.  The <code>yacite render</code> command reads a YAML stream
on its input, fills in the template, and then produces HTML on its output. </p>
<p>There are more things that <code>yacite render</code> does (like dealing with
citations) but, for the moment, we do not care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save the resulting HTML into a file using the redirect sign <code>&gt;</code> :</p>
<pre><code>bib2yaml mypubs.bib | yacite render publist.html &gt; mypubs.html
</code></pre>
<p>and open the <code>mypubs.html</code> in you favourite browser. Enjoy the result. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to alter the
    template; for example, change the <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/ol&gt;</code> tags to <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>
    and <code>&lt;/ul&gt;</code>, respectively, and observe the results in <code>mypubs.html</code>. 
    Note that you need to click the reload button in your browser to see the 
    updates in a HTML document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you need to create a MS Word document, there are some ways how to convert a
    simple HTML document to a <code>.doc</code> file. For example, you can try the
    excellent <code>pandoc</code> document conversion utility. In addition, as I was
    told, MS Word should be capable to load a HTML file and save it as a
    MS Word file.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Lesson 2: Filtering the YAML stream</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Try the following command</p>
<pre><code>bib2yaml mypubs.bib | yacite filter 'year == 2012'
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the argument of the <code>yacite filter</code> command in enclosed in
apostrophes. This tell the shell to pass it to the <code>yacite</code> as a
single argument.  The argument <code>year == 2012</code> is a Python expression.</p>
<p>The result should be a filtered YAML stream that contains only the
2012 publications. </p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The <code>yacite filter</code> command evaluates the <code>year == 2012</code>
expression in the environment given by the record in stream. If the
expression is true, the records is outputted, otherwise it is skipped.</p>
<p>You can now try create a HTML document using <code>yacite render</code>, as in
the previous example.</p>
<pre><code>bib2yaml mypubs.bib | yacite filter 'year == 2012' | yacite render publist.html &gt; mypubs_2012.html
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alter the argument of <code>yacite filter</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>bib2yaml mypubs.bib | yacite filter '"the" in title' | yacite render publist.html &gt; mypubs_the.html
</code></pre>
<p>This should create a list of publications containg 'the' as a
substring of the title.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use conjunction (<code>and</code>), disjunction (<code>or</code>), negation ('not'):</p>
<pre><code>... yacite filter '("Fourier" in title) or "(Laplace" in title)' ...
... yacite filter '(year &gt; 2000) and (year &lt;= 2010)' ...
... yacite filter 'not ("semigroup" in keywords)' ...
</code></pre>
<p>Let me remark that the last command is equivalent to much more
readable</p>
<pre><code>... yacite filter '"Effect" not in keywords' ...
</code></pre>
<p>We refer to Python tutorial for more information about Python
expressions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Lesson 3: Persistence: saving the data into database directory</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In <code>yacite</code>, data are saved in plain YAML documents, one record per
    file. The documents are saved in a database directory, called <em>datadir</em>. 
    Currently, datadir simple and allows for editing the
    data in place using any text editor, since there are no metadata.</p>
<p>Create the datadir:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir pubcit
</code></pre>
<p>The name of the datadir does not matter at all.
1.  The command <code>yacite merge</code> reads the YAML stream from its input
and saves the individual records in the datadir.</p>
<pre><code>bib2yaml mypubs.bib | yacite merge pubcit
</code></pre>
<p>You see a couple of log messages saying that some new records were
created. Go into the <code>pubcit</code> directory and look around. There is 
a couple of files with the name scheme</p>
<p><code>pubcit/${YEAR}/${AUTHOR}${YEAR}${TITLEWORD}.yaml</code></p>
<p><code>${AUTHOR}</code> is the surname of the first author.
<code>${TITLEWORD}</code> is the first word in the title, unless it is too short,
like "a" or "the". In this case, <code>${TITLEWORD}</code> are first two word of
the title. The name scheme makes it easy to find individual records.</p>
<p>When you open one the files you in a text editor can see that in every
file a new field <code>key</code> was created. The value of <code>key</code> is
<code>${AUTHOR}${YEAR}${TITLEWORD}</code>. It is easy to infer the value of <code>key</code>
whan looking at a paper.
1.  Sometimes, there are multiple records with the same first author, year
and the first word of the title. If this happens, a suffix <code>-1</code> (or
more) is appended to <code>key</code> and to the corresponding part of the
filename.
1.  Try again the command </p>
<pre><code>bib2yaml mypubs.bib | yacite merge pubcit
</code></pre>
<p>Hopefully, nothing happens. 
For every record on its input, <code>yacite merge</code> figured out using a
heuristics that the record on its input points (in the real world) 
to the same article as the one stored in 
the database. Since every filed value in the input record (except for the <code>key</code>, which is
ignored in this respect) is the same as the stored one, there nothing
to do and the stored record is unchanged.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Lesson 4: Marking the records as your own</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Let us start with a clean table. Remove the datadir and start with an
    empty one.</p>
<pre><code>rm -rv pubcit
mkdir pubcit
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try this command</p>
<pre><code>bib2yaml mypubs.bib | yacite exec 'myown=True`
</code></pre>
<p>The result is an altered YAML stream. There is a new field,
<code>myown</code> with value <code>true</code> in every record. Note the difference;
<code>True</code> is a Python constant, <code>true</code> is a YAML constant. Also,
there is a single <code>=</code>, not <code>==</code>; we are assigning a value, not making
a comparision.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The <code>yacite exec</code> command executes the Python command 
(in this case, <code>myown=True</code>) in the environment given by the record in stream. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now let the altered YAML stream flow into the <code>yacite merge</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>bib2yaml mypubs.bib | yacite exec 'myown=True` | yacite merge pubcit
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the filenames are different now: every new file is placed
into a <code>myown</code> subdirectory. This allows one to easily find his/her
own records.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Lesson 5: Reading the database directory</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The command <code>yacite read</code> reads all data in the datadir and outputs
    them as a YAML stream:</p>
<pre><code>yacite read pubcit
</code></pre>
<p>You can render the stream using a template:</p>
<pre><code>yacite read pubcit | yacite render publist.html &gt; out.html
</code></pre>
<p>Try to put some <code>yacite filter</code> in the middle of the pipe sequence
and look at the result.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Lesson 6: Tagging the records in the database directory</h2>
<ol>
<li>There are two ways how to update records in the datadir: either direct
    editing or via the <code>yacite merge</code> command. Direct editing should be
    clear: just edit the files using any text editor. This is aprropriate
    for individual changes.</li>
<li>
<p>Let us supose we that all the data in datadir were created from
    SCOPUS. We would like to mark them as such. One of the possibilities
    would be to add a boolean variable <code>scopus</code> in every record, as we
    did with <code>myown</code> in one of the above examples.</p>
<pre><code>yacite read pubcit | yacite exec 'scopus=True' | yacite merge pubcit
</code></pre>
<p>However, this is not necessarily a good idea, because, for example,
it is not clear from looking at the data which fields are "real data"
and which are "custom marks". It is better to equip
every record with a list of strings, let us say <code>tags</code>. There is a
special pair of commands for manipulation with lists of strings,
namely <code>yacite append</code> and <code>yacite unappend</code>. Look at the output of
this command:</p>
<pre><code>yacite read pubcit | yacite append tags scopus
</code></pre>
<p>There is <code>tags: [scopus]</code> in every record in the resulting YAML stream.
Let the stream flow back into the database:</p>
<pre><code>yacite read pubcit | yacite append tags scopus | yacite merge pubcit
</code></pre>
<p>The merge command displays a couple of log messages about creating new fields for every
record in the database. 
1.  Let us mark the records older than 2005 as old. This can be done using
sequence of filtering and marking: </p>
<pre><code>yacite read pubcit | yacite filter 'year&lt;2005' | yacite append tags old
</code></pre>
<p>This works as expected, the resulting YAML stream contains either '[scopus,old]'
or '[scopus]' as the value of 'tags', depending of the value of year. However,<br />
</p>
<pre><code>yacite read pubcit | yacite filter 'year&lt;2005' | yacite append tags old | yacite merge pubcit
</code></pre>
<p>produces a strange message about "bounced" fields. To see what
happened, try the '-v' option (v is for verbose):</p>
<pre><code>yacite read pubcit | yacite filter 'year&lt;2005' | yacite append tags old | yacite merge -v pubcit
</code></pre>
<p>Every changed <code>tags</code> field bounced. What happened? The <code>yacite merge</code>
command recognized that the records in the YAML stream are new
versions of the records in the database and that the value of <code>tags</code>
is different. <code>yacite merge</code> is careful, it does not change existing
data unless explicily said to do so.
And did not say what to do with the changed value of <code>tags</code>. What
we want to do is to set <code>tags</code> to the new value. This command
does the trick:</p>
<pre><code>yacite read pubcit | yacite filter 'year&lt;2005' | yacite append tags old | yacite merge -s tags pubcit
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-s tags</code> says that the value of <code>tags</code> should be updated to the
value obtained from the YAML stream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let us delete the 'old' tag (it was a silly example anyway).</p>
<pre><code>yacite read pubcit | yacite unappend tags old
</code></pre>
<p>shows a YAML stream without any <code>old</code> tag among <code>tags</code>. The rest of
the task of deleting the <code>old</code> tag is left as an excercise to the esteemed reader.<br />
