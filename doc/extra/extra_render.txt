**IMPLEMENTATION:**

> The render subcommand  produces the final result: the list of
> citations. The data is passed to the jinja2 python library, which uses a
> template to produce the list of citations. The jinja2 template language is
> documented at the [jinja2 site](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/) .

> Currently, the templates are expected to be in the subdirectory `templates`
> of the current directory. You can use `#` as the prefix of jinja2 tag lines.
> The environment passed to the template consists of
> the following data:

> `records`
>> List of dictionaries, includes all of the data in the input YAML
>> stream. Additionally, the following data are computed/altered:

>> - in the input YAML the `cites` fields is expected to contain list of keys to
     `key`s of other records. The keys (i.e. strings) are replaced by
     records to the corresponding keys themselves.
>> - in every record, a new `citedby` field is created. The field is a list of
     records that cite the current record via the `cites` field.

> `extra`
>> Some python data from the argument of the -e option.

**EXAMPLE TEMPLATE:**

    # for bibrec in records
    # if bibrec.myown
    {{ bibrec.authors|join(", ") }}:{{bibrec.title}} {{bibrec.year}}
    # if bibrec.citedby
    Was cited by:
    # for cit in bibrec citedby
      * {{ bibrec.authors|join(", ") }}:{{bibrec.title}} {{bibrec.year}}
    # endfor
    # endif
    # endif
    # endfor 

** CUSTOM FILTERS:**

> `authorsformat(*bst-name-format*)`
>> expects list of authors, rewrites them according to given BibTeX style
>> name format string. See http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb27-2/tb87hufflen.pdf
>> for details.

** EXAMPLE USAGE IN A TEMPLATE:**

    {{ rec.authors|authorsformat("{f. }{vv}{ll{ }}{, jj}")|join(", ") }}
