**HOW DOES THE MERGE COMMAND WORK:**

> merge means this:

- for each *newrecord* in *stdin*
	- determine how many records in *datadir* are "very similar"
	  to *newrecord*, that means
	  one of the following:
		- same key
		- same year,title,authors
		- same journal name,volume,startpage 
		- same article-id
	- if there is more than one record in datadir very similar to
	  *newrecord*, then fail with an error.
	- if there is no record in datadir very similar to *newrecord*, then
	  CREATE a new file as follows:
		- generate a new key field in *newrecord* (if not present)
		- create a new file in datadir. The filename of the new file is 
			- *datadir*/*year*/*key*`.yaml`, if the boolean-valued 
			  field *newrecord*[myown] is not true or not present
			- *datadir*/myown/*year/*key*`.yaml` if
			  *newrecord*`[myown]` is true.
	- if there is exacly one record in datadir very similar to
	  *newrecord*, then UPDATE the matching record (called *match* from
	  now on) in *datadir* with values from
	  *newrecord* according to the following rules
	  - for each *fieldname* in *newrecord*
		- if *fieldname* is not present in *match*, extend *match* by
		  new *fieldname*=*fieldvalue*
		- if *fieldname* is present in *match* but its values are the
		  same in *newrecord* and in *match*, do nothing
		- if *fieldname* is present in match and its values are
		  distinct if *newrecord* and in *match* then UPDATE the
		  corresponding field in *match* according to the '-s', '-u'
		  or '-d' options of the 'yacite merge' command, meaning this:
			  - if *fieldname* is one of the *SNAME*s, the set the value
			    in *match* to the value in *newrecord*
			  - if *fieldname* is one of the *UNAME*s, then the values in
			    botch *newrecord* and *match* must be of the type "list of
			    something". The value in *match* is extended by the value
			    in in *newrecord*.
			  - if *fieldname* is one of the *DNAME*s, then the
			    corresponding field in *match* is deleted.
			  - if *fieldname* is not present in any of *UNAME* *SNAME*
			    *DNAME*, then a warning is issued with level according to
			    '-v' and '-q' options.
